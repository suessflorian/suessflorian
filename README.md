### Hi

NZ based software engineer trying to get more into open source. I carry quite a bit of interest in Go, with particular focus on projects such as [bramble](https://github.com/movio/bramble), [graph-gophers](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go), [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen), right now. Currently learning a little more about [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/intro-whatis.html), with particular focus on extensions like [`pg_trgm`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html), [`postgres_fdw`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/postgres-fdw.html) and [`pg_roaringbitmap`](https://github.com/ChenHuajun/pg_roaringbitmap).

Other interests include; tackling scalability problems, debating software architectures, recommender systems via matrix factorization, using [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), (py)spark alternatives like [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask).

I like to document my learnings in the forms of small problem-centric projects, please check them out!
